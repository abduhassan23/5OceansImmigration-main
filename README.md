### General Prompts

1. **Prompt:** "How can I implement a dynamic theme system in React that uses localStorage to remember the user's theme preference?"

   - **Dynamic Theme System:** Developed a theme management system using `localStorage` to save and retrieve the user's theme preference, updating the UI dynamically across multiple pages like `communitypage.js`, `contactpage.js`, `expressentry.js`, `immigrationpermits.js`, and `sponsorapplication.js`.

2. **Prompt:** "How can I create a function to toggle between dark and light themes in React and save the preference in localStorage?"

   - **Dark and Light Theme Toggle:** Implemented theme toggle functionality to switch between dark and light themes, update `localStorage`, and dynamically change styles across multiple components.

3. **Prompt:** "Can you show me how to avoid rendering a React component on the server-side and only render it after the component is mounted?"

   - **Client-Side Rendering Check:** Added state checks (`isMounted`) to ensure that components render only after being mounted on the client-side, preventing SSR issues across various components.

4. **Prompt:** "Can you help me use the Next.js Image component to display optimized images?"

   - **Next.js Image Component Usage:** Used the Next.js `Image` component for efficient and responsive image rendering, improving performance and SEO across multiple pages.

5. **Prompt:** "Can you show me how to add transition effects when switching between light and dark themes in a React component?"

   - **Smooth Transition Effects:** Implemented CSS transitions for smooth visual effects when toggling between themes in various components, enhancing user experience.

6. **Prompt:** "How can I create a visually appealing button in React with dynamic styling based on the current theme?"
   - **Dynamic Button Styling:** Styled buttons dynamically based on the theme state (`isDarkMode`) in multiple components, ensuring visual consistency.

### `communitypage.js`

1. **Prompt:** "Can you please find me a React library I can use to get some cool icons?"

   - **Lucide React Library:** Integrated the `lucide-react` library for icon components, providing a wide range of customizable icons.
   - [Lucide React Documentation](https://lucide.dev/docs/lucide-react)

2. **Prompt:** "Can you please add error handling in the code to ensure the application handles failures gracefully and provides appropriate user feedback?"
   - **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling for API requests using React state variables to capture and display error messages for a better user experience.

### `contactpage.js`

1. **Prompt:** "Can you help me detect if the component is mounted on the client-side and apply the user's saved theme preference using localStorage?"
   - **Client-Side Theme Detection:** Used a `useEffect` hook to check for the theme preference in `localStorage` and apply it on component mount, ensuring proper theme rendering.

### `expressentry.js`

1. **Prompt:** "How can I check for the saved theme in localStorage and apply it when the component mounts?"
   - **Theme Initialization:** Checked and applied the saved theme preference from `localStorage` on component mount, adjusting the document body styles accordingly.

### `immigrationpermits.js`

1. **Prompt:** "Can you help me with creating responsive image layouts using Next.js Image component?"
   - **Responsive Image Layouts:** Utilized the Next.js `Image` component for adaptive image sizes and quality, ensuring the images are optimized for different screen sizes.

### `servicespage.js`

1. **Prompt:** "Can you add animations to my React components using Framer Motion for elements like headers, buttons, and images?"

   - **Animating Section Headers and Buttons:** Framer Motion is used to animate the section headers, buttons, and images throughout the page, providing a smooth user experience with visual transitions.

2. **Prompt:** "How can I create a staggered animation effect for a list of items in React using Framer Motion?"
   - **Staggered Animations for Feature Cards:** Staggered animations are applied to the feature cards under the "What to expect from our services" section, enhancing visual appeal and engagement.

### `sponsorapplication.js`

1. **Prompt:** "How can I ensure that my React component only renders on the client-side after it is mounted?"

   - **Client-Side Rendering Check:** Used a state variable (`isMounted`) to conditionally render the component only after it is mounted on the client-side, preventing SSR issues.

2. **Prompt:** "Can you help me use the Next.js Image component to display optimized images?"
   - **Next.js Image Component Usage:** Implemented the `Image` component from Next.js to display optimized images for better performance and SEO.

### threads `route.js`

1. **Prompt:** "How can I handle search queries with case-insensitive matching in Prisma?"

   - **Prisma Case-Insensitive Search:** Used the `contains` filter with the `mode: 'insensitive'` option in Prisma to allow case-insensitive string matching for both the `title` and `content` fields in thread search queries.

2. **Prompt:** "How can I add a flag to indicate if the user has liked a thread?"

   - **User Like Flag:** Added logic to map over the threads and append a `userHasLiked` field, which checks if the current user (passed through `userId`) has already liked the thread based on `threadLikes`.

3. **Prompt:** "How can I validate and create a new thread while ensuring all required fields are present?"

   - **Field Validation and Thread Creation:** Added error handling to validate the required fields (`title`, `content`, `category`, `userId`) and return an error if any are missing before proceeding with Prismaâ€™s `create` method to insert the new thread.

### posts `route.js`

1. **Prompt:** "How can I implement error handling when creating and deleting posts using Prisma and Next.js?"

- **Error Handling for Post Creation and Deletion:** Implemented robust error handling using try-catch blocks. When creating a post, if required fields are missing, the API returns a `400 Bad Request` response. Additionally, if the server encounters an issue, it returns a `500 Internal Server Error` with details about the failure, ensuring that both client-side and server-side issues are handled gracefully.

2. **Prompt:** "How can I fetch a post by its ID and check if it exists using Prisma?"

- **Fetching Post by ID:** Implemented a query using Prisma's `findUnique` method to fetch a post by its `postId`. The query includes a selection of specific fields (such as `userId`) to verify the post's existence before proceeding with further actions, like deletion. If the post does not exist, the API returns a `404 Not Found` response.

3. **Prompt:** "How can I implement an authorization check to ensure only the creator can delete the post?"

- **Authorization Check for Post Deletion:** Added a security check to ensure that only the creator of the post can delete it. By comparing the `userId` of the post with the `userId` of the deletion request, unauthorized users attempting to delete the post are denied, returning a `403 Forbidden` response.

### `generateContent` `route.js`

1. **Prompt:** "How can I generate content using the Gemini API based on a provided message?"

- **AI Content Generation:** Implemented a function to handle the generation of content using the Gemini API. The function takes a message as input, sends it to the Gemini API, and returns the generated content. If the API key is missing or an error occurs, appropriate error handling is in place.
